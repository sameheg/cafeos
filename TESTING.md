## References
- Additional resources and documentation about Testing for further learning.


## Types of Tests
- Unit tests → Pest/PHPUnit.  
- Integration tests → module interactions.  
- E2E tests → Cypress/Dusk.  

## Commands
```bash
composer test
npm run test:e2e
```

## Coverage
- Minimum 80% coverage per module.  

## CI Integration
- All PRs trigger full test suite.

## Unit Tests
- Execute fast feedback loops with Pest.
```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```
```

```

## Performance Tests
- Assess client performance with Cypress.
```bash
npx cypress run --config-file cypress.performance.config.js
```
```
All specs passed!                             3 of 3 completed (2s)
```

## Model Validation
- Verify AI model quality and response speed.
```bash
python scripts/validate_models.py
```
```
