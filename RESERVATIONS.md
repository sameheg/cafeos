## API
- `POST /api/reservations` – Create reservation.
- `GET /api/reservations` – List reservations.
- `DELETE /api/reservations/{id}` – Cancel reservation.

## Use Case
### Create a table reservation
1. Send a `POST` request to create a reservation:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.example.com/reservations \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"table_id":12,"customer_name":"Alice","time":"2025-09-15T19:00:00Z","party_size":4}'
   ```
2. Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "id": 101,
     "table_id": 12,
     "customer_name": "Alice",
     "time": "2025-09-15T19:00:00Z",
     "party_size": 4,
     "status": "confirmed"
   }
   ```
3. Verify the reservation exists:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://api.example.com/reservations?customer_name=Alice
   ```
