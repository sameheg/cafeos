- Allowing users to change preferences in self-service portals.

## Setup Steps
1. Enable the consent service in the admin panel.
2. Define consent categories such as marketing or analytics.
3. Integrate the API with signup and profile forms.

## Example Configuration
```bash
# Create a new consent record via API
curl -X POST https://api.cafeos.example/consents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"user_id":123,"category":"marketing","status":"opt_in"}'
```

## Scenario
When a new user registers, the signup form calls the consent API to store their choice.
If the user later updates their preferences, the system logs the change and sends a notification to compliance teams.
