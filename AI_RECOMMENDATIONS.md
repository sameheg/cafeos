# AI Recommendations

## Overview
- This section outlines the primary goals and scope of Ai Recommendations.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Ai Recommendations concepts and system requirements is recommended.

## Setup
- Follow these steps to configure and enable Ai Recommendations in your environment.

## Usage
- Instructions and examples for applying Ai Recommendations in day-to-day operations.

## References
- Additional resources and documentation about Ai Recommendations for further learning.


## Features
- Product upsell
- Cross-sell recommendations
- Personalized offers

## Model Choice
- Collaborative filtering for user-item affinity.
- Association rule mining for bundle suggestions.

## Data Requirements
- `orders` and `order_items` for purchase history.
- `customers` for demographics.
- `loyalty` for reward tier segmentation.

## Training Pipeline
1. Build user-item matrix from `orders` and `order_items`.
2. Join with `customers` and `loyalty` for user features.
3. Train recommender system and expose API endpoint.

### Sample Code (Python)
```python
import pandas as pd

orders = pd.read_sql('SELECT customer_id, sku FROM order_items JOIN orders ON orders.id = order_items.order_id', con=db_conn)
pivot = orders.pivot_table(index='customer_id', columns='sku', aggfunc='size', fill_value=0)
# pass `pivot` to recommendation engine
```

### Sample Code (PHP)
```php
<?php
$pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);
$sql = 'SELECT customer_id, sku FROM order_items JOIN orders ON orders.id = order_items.order_id';
$data = $pdo->query($sql)->fetchAll();
// Send $data to recommendation service
?>
```

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision@K and Recall@K.
- Click-through rate.
- Conversion uplift.

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Check recommendation algorithms with Pest.
```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --testsuite=recommendations-unit
```
```
Pest 2.x
✓ ranks top products
```

### Integration Tests
- Validate data joins via PHPUnit.
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=recommendations-integration
```
```
PHPUnit 9.x
..                                                                  2 / 2 (100%)
```

### Performance Tests
- Use Cypress to profile recommendation latency.
```bash
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/recommendations.cy.js
```
```
All specs passed!                             1 of 1 completed (1s)
```

### Model Validation
- Verify precision and response times.
```bash
python scripts/validate_recommendations.py
```
```
precision@5=0.27 latency=220ms
```
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Accuracy (Precision@5) ≥ 0.25
- Latency ≤ 250ms
