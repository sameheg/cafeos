# Cost Optimization (FinOps)

## Overview
- This section outlines the primary goals and scope of Cost Optimization.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Cost Optimization concepts and system requirements is recommended.

## Setup
- Follow these steps to configure and enable Cost Optimization in your environment.

## Usage
- Instructions and examples for applying Cost Optimization in day-to-day operations.

## References
- Additional resources and documentation about Cost Optimization for further learning.


## Overview
Ensures cloud resources are cost-efficient.

## Techniques
- Auto-scaling
- Spot instances
- Reserved capacity
- Storage lifecycle policies

## Reporting
- Monthly cost dashboards
- Tenant-level cost allocation

## Use Cases
- Lowering bills during off-peak hours by scaling down resources.
- Choosing spot instances for stateless workloads.
- Identifying idle resources for termination.

## Setup Steps
1. Connect the platform to your cloud provider billing API.
2. Define budgets and alerts for each tenant.
3. Enable auto-scaling policies in the orchestration layer.

## Example Configuration
```yaml
autoscaling:
  min: 2
  max: 10
  policy: cpu
budget_alerts:
  threshold: 500
  email: finops@cafeos.example
```

## Scenario
A tenant's service exceeds 80% CPU for a sustained period; auto-scaling launches new instances and cost alerts monitor spend.
When usage drops, the system scales in to minimize costs.
