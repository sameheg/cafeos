# Admin Panel

The EliteSaaS admin panel is built with Filament v3. Super admins can manage
users, roles and modules from this interface.

## User Management

- Create, edit and delete users.
- Assign roles using [Spatie\Permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/basic-usage).
- Import or export users from the table header actions.
- All changes are recorded via [Spatie Activitylog](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-activitylog/v4/introduction).

To access the panel run the development server and visit `/admin`.
