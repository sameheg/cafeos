## Usage
- Instructions and examples for applying Ai Chatbot in day-to-day operations.

## References
- Additional resources and documentation about Ai Chatbot for further learning.


## Features
- Customer support automation
- FAQ handling
- Escalation to human agents

## Model Choice
- Generative pretrained transformer for dialog management.
- Retrieval module for FAQs.

## Data Requirements
- `customers` for user profiles.
- `orders` for recent purchase context.
- `loyalty` for reward status.

## Training Pipeline
1. Aggregate historical chats linked to `customers`.
2. Index FAQs and order history.
3. Fine-tune the chatbot and deploy endpoint.

### Sample Code (Python)
```python
import requests

payload = {"customer_id": 7, "message": "Where is my order?"}
resp = requests.post(
    "https://api.cafeos.local/chatbot",
    json=payload,
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer TOKEN"},
)
print(resp.json())
```

### Sample Code (PHP)
```php
<?php
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->post('https://api.cafeos.local/chatbot', [
    'json' => ['customer_id' => 7, 'message' => 'Where is my order?'],
    'headers' => ['Authorization' => 'Bearer TOKEN']
]);
echo $response->getBody();
?>
```

## Evaluation Metrics
- Response accuracy.
- Resolution rate.
- Customer satisfaction.

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Validate dialog utilities with Pest.
```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --testsuite=chatbot-unit
```
```
Pest 2.x
✓ formats greeting
```

### Integration Tests
- Check API endpoints via PHPUnit.
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=chatbot-integration
```
```
PHPUnit 9.x
..                                                                  2 / 2 (100%)
```

### Performance Tests
- Run Cypress scripts for load and latency.
```bash
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/chatbot.cy.js
```
```
All specs passed!                             1 of 1 completed (1s)
```

### Model Validation
- Evaluate conversational accuracy and response time.
```bash
python scripts/validate_chatbot.py
```
```
accuracy=0.88 latency=210ms
```
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Accuracy ≥ 0.85
- Latency ≤ 250ms
