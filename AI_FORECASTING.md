# AI Forecasting

## Overview
- This section outlines the primary goals and scope of Ai Forecasting.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Ai Forecasting concepts and system requirements is recommended.

## Setup
- Follow these steps to configure and enable Ai Forecasting in your environment.

## Usage
- Instructions and examples for applying Ai Forecasting in day-to-day operations.

## References
- Additional resources and documentation about Ai Forecasting for further learning.


## Features
- Predict inventory demand
- Forecast sales trends
- AI-driven staffing optimization

## Model Choice
- Time-series models such as Prophet or ARIMA.
- LSTM networks for complex patterns.

## Data Requirements
- `orders` and `order_items` for historical sales.
- `inventory_items` for stock levels.
- `subscriptions` for seasonality signals.

## Training Pipeline
1. Pull order history from `orders` and `order_items`.
2. Merge with `inventory_items` to estimate stock-outs.
3. Train forecasting model and serialize artifacts.

### Sample Code (Python)
```python
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet

orders = pd.read_sql('SELECT created_at, total FROM orders', con=db_conn)
model = Prophet().fit(orders.rename(columns={"created_at": "ds", "total": "y"}))
forecast = model.predict(model.make_future_dataframe(30))
```

### Sample Code (PHP)
```php
<?php
$pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);
$stmt = $pdo->query('SELECT created_at, total FROM orders');
$data = $stmt->fetchAll();
// Pass $data to forecasting service
?>
```

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
- Root mean square error (RMSE).
- Inventory turnover improvement.
