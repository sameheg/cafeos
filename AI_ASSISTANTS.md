# AI Assistants (Future)

## Overview
- This section outlines the primary goals and scope of Ai Assistants.

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic Ai Assistants concepts and system requirements is recommended.

## Setup
- Follow these steps to configure and enable Ai Assistants in your environment.

## Usage
- Instructions and examples for applying Ai Assistants in day-to-day operations.

## References
- Additional resources and documentation about Ai Assistants for further learning.


## Overview
AI-driven features planned.

## Use Cases
- Predict inventory reorders
- Suggest promotions
- Chatbot for support

## Model Choice
- Large language models for conversational tasks.
- Gradient boosted trees for tabular predictions.

## Data Requirements
- `orders` for sales context.
- `inventory_items` for stock levels.
- `customers` for personalization.

## Training Pipeline
1. Extract data from `orders`, `inventory_items`, and `customers` tables.
2. Clean and aggregate records per tenant.
3. Fine-tune the assistant model and store artifacts.

### Sample Code (Python)
```python
import requests

payload = {"order_id": 42}
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.cafeos.local/assist",
    json=payload,
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer TOKEN"},
)
print(response.json())
```

### Sample Code (PHP)
```php
<?php
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->post('https://api.cafeos.local/assist', [
    'json' => ['order_id' => 42],
    'headers' => ['Authorization' => 'Bearer TOKEN']
]);
echo $response->getBody();
?>
```

## Evaluation Metrics
- Task completion rate.
- Average response time.
- User satisfaction score.

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Verify assistant helpers with Pest.
```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --testsuite=assistants-unit
```
```
Pest 2.x
✓ generates suggestion
```

### Integration Tests
- Ensure service wiring via PHPUnit.
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=assistants-integration
```
```
PHPUnit 9.x
..                                                                  2 / 2 (100%)
```

### Performance Tests
- Measure request latency using Cypress.
```bash
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/assistants.cy.js
```
```
All specs passed!                             1 of 1 completed (1s)
```

### Model Validation
- Evaluate model accuracy and latency.
```bash
python scripts/validate_assistants.py
```
```
accuracy=0.92 latency=190ms
```
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Accuracy ≥ 0.90
- Latency ≤ 200ms
