## Overview
AI-driven features planned.

## Use Cases

- Suggest promotions
- Chatbot for support

## Model Choice
- Large language models for conversational tasks.
- Gradient boosted trees for tabular predictions.

## Data Requirements
- `orders` for sales context.
- `inventory_items` for stock levels.
- `customers` for personalization.

## Training Pipeline
1. Extract data from `orders`, `inventory_items`, and `customers` tables.
2. Clean and aggregate records per tenant.
3. Fine-tune the assistant model and store artifacts.

### Sample Code (Python)
```python
import requests

payload = {"order_id": 42}
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.cafeos.local/assist",
    json=payload,
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer TOKEN"},
)
print(response.json())
```

### Sample Code (PHP)
```php
<?php
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->post('https://api.cafeos.local/assist', [
    'json' => ['order_id' => 42],
    'headers' => ['Authorization' => 'Bearer TOKEN']
]);
echo $response->getBody();
?>
```

## Evaluation Metrics
